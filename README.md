# The Motive
Floods are significant challenges for the residents on the island of Montreal. This April, more than 30 mm of freezing rain fell on the island of montreal. This had caused blackouts in several Montreal communities, with over 480,000 citizens affected. This august, Montreal was hit by the tropical storm Debby which dumped more than 173 millimeters of rain in certain neighborhoods and caused more than 2.5 billion dollars in total damages for the entire province - the most expensive weather disaster in its history.
