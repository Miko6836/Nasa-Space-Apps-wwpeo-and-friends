# Sewage System Optimization for Flood Mitigation in Montreal
Community Mapping project for Nasa Space Apps 2024

## The Motive
Floods are significant challenges for the residents on the island of Montreal. This august, Montreal was hit by the tropical storm Debby which dumped more than 173 millimeters of rain in many neighborhoods and caused more than 2.5 billion dollars in total damages for the entire province - the most expensive weather disaster in its history. 

## Objective
We decided to combat this issue by firstly identifying key areas with high vulnerability to floods and its correlation with geographic information. Then, we mapped out the location of major sewage and water retention locations in combination with the previous mappings to determine the locations that are the most in need for new drainage systems. 

## Digital Elevation Model
We have linked a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Island of Montreal, which a map that shows the different altitudes of the island. The darker areas represent lower altitudes, which are typically more susceptible to flooding and may potentially need more drainage systems. 

## Vulneraility Map and Sewage Infrastructure
This second map further highlights vulnerability to hydrometeorological hazards across Montreal, such as storms and heavy rainfall. The semi-opaque red areas show where the risk is highest, with darker red indicating more vulnerability. This confirms our hypothesis with our previous maps with lower sea level areas being more vulnerable to floods. 
The black areas represent the locations of major water retention areas and sewage infrastructure. In the most vulnerable areas – highlighted through purple dots – we should prioritize building new drainage systems to reduce the risk of severe flooding and damage. These strategic placements will aim to improve the overall efficiency of floodwater management.

## Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, the fight against flooding in Montreal can be won with strategic planning and data-driven solutions. By optimizing the city’s drainage systems, using predictive technology, and making informed decisions based on historical data, we can reduce the impact of extreme weather events and make Montreal more resilient. This will not only save millions of dollars but will also protect communities from future disasters. We estimate that these infrastructure improvements could potentially reduce damages from future floods by a significant margin. 
As part of our next steps, We also propose using real-time weather data and machine learning models to predict and respond to flooding risks as they happen. By incorporating live weather feeds, city planners and emergency services can anticipate floods, adjust the drainage system dynamically, and mitigate damage in real-time. This will lead to better decision-making and resource allocation. We also plan to work closely with municipal planners to integrate these solutions into existing city frameworks.
