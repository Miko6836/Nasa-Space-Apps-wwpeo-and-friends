# Sewage System Optimization for Flood Mitigation in Montreal
Community Mapping project for Nasa Space Apps 2024

## The Motive
Floods are significant challenges for the residents on the island of Montreal. This august, Montreal was hit by the tropical storm Debby which dumped more than 173 millimeters of rain in many neighborhoods and caused more than 2.5 billion dollars in total damages for the entire province - the most expensive weather disaster in its history. 

We decided to combat this issue by firstly identifying key areas with high vulnerability to floods and its correlation with geographic information. Then, we mapped out the location of major sewage and water retention locations in combination with the previous mappings to determine the locations that are the most in need for new drainage systems.
